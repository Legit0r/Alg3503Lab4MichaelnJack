# Specific Requirements

Your algorithm must be an approximation algorithm, it is not allowed
to check all possibilities.

• Your algorithm does not have to find the optimal solution for all cases
but it should find a good solution for most cases.

• The input includes the capacity of the bins followed by the number
of items N followed by the items themselves separated by spaces. For
instance, the input for the above problem is 20 8 12 4 8 15 9 3 1
10 Here B=20, N=8, and the 8 items follow. See the Scanner class
which allows you to read data from the Java console (standard input).
Your output should be the list of elements in each bin, the list of the
unpacked items, and the amount of unused space. Please make your
answers readable.

• You may use any of the algorithms implemented in Java Collections
class or any other predefined Java algorithms.
See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/algorithms/index.html
for a tutorial on the Collections class.
